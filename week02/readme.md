## Challenge Description

Creating a pattern in Javascript

## Explain your solution

This was very hard and took a very long time. I tried to take it in pieces and start from top to bottom. From the description I knew I was using for loops and that i was nesting another for loop.  For the first for loop I used the flow chart. I noticed that x = 1, x <=6 and from class you need the i++ as its increasing in value.  For the second loop I used the flow chart as well. y=1 y< x and y++ here though i am not actually sure of y's purpose but went with it anyway. And from there I just went with the flow chart. In the end kept getting undefined and the characters printing all on one line. it took me another hour to learn that it was a misseplaced semicolon.

## What are you thoughts about this challenge? Did you like it?

I am still struggling with loops. Like when to use, what loop to use. I now know I should have paid more attention in math class when coering word problems.

## What have you learned from it?
I learned that I a visual learner. I understood more with the flow chart than words.
